	A masterwork of stonecraft and steam ingenuity, the Geyser Core must be built atop an active geyser to function. It channels the earth's heat to adjacent workstations, granting significant work speed bonuses and automatically fueling connected benches. Made entirely from fireproof stone, it also emits a soft, steady glow and gently regulates indoor temperature, making it a vital fixture for any workshop.

Though fully functional on its own, the Smokeforge receives a significant work speed bonus when connected to a Geyser Core. Constructed entirely from stone, it is immune to fire. Ideal for colonies that value speed—and don't mind the heat.
