	A side effect of air-conditioner cooling is the water drawn out through evaporator coils. An Atmospheric Water Generator takes advantage of this effect to draw and filter as much water from the ambient humidity as possible. This will never produce as much water as other options but it works to some degree in almost all weather patterns.
