	Original:
	Developed by IRA's Extraterrestrial Biohazard Division under CAG commission. This geological resonance system provides early-stage biological countermeasures for frontier colonies. Emits 19Hz low-frequency waves into subterranean strata, inducing skeletal resonance in flesh beasts or insects and disrupting their burrowing neural signals. Effectively paralyzes all underground excavation activities within 52-tile radius.
